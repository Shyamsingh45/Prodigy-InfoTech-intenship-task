Task-01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
Sample Dataset :-
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

- Imported libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Loaded order data into a pandas DataFrame
- Created a count plot to visualize orders across state
- Generated a histogram to show the distribution of order totals
- Learned about data visualization and data preparation
     
Task-02
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values and dropped irrelevant columns
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used scatter plots, count plots, etc., to unveil insights
- Feature Engineering: Created new features to enrich the dataset
- Explored relationships between variables and survival rate/fare
     
Task-03
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.f
Sample Dateset :-
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

- Loaded and preprocessed the Bank Marketing dataset
- Trained a decision tree classifier and evaluated its performance
- Visualized the decision tree using plot_tree from sklearn.tree
- Gained insights into decision tree classifiers and their applications
     
Task-04
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
Sample Dataset :-
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

- Used Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset
- Cleaned data, preprocessed text, and encoded variables
- Conducted EDA, analyzed sentiment scores distribution, and visualized sentiment trends
- Applied sentiment analysis using Power BI techniques and created interactive visualizations
