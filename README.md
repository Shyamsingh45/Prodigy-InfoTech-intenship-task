Task-01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
Sample Dataset :-
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

- Imported libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Loaded order data into a pandas DataFrame
- Created a count plot to visualize orders across state
- Generated a histogram to show the distribution of order totals
- Learned about data visualization and data preparation
     
Task-02
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values and dropped irrelevant columns
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used scatter plots, count plots, etc., to unveil insights
- Feature Engineering: Created new features to enrich the dataset
- Explored relationships between variables and survival rate/fare
     
Task-03
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.f
Sample Dateset :-
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

- Loaded and preprocessed the Bank Marketing dataset
- Trained a decision tree classifier and evaluated its performance
- Visualized the decision tree using plot_tree from sklearn.tree
- Gained insights into decision tree classifiers and their applications
     
Task-04
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
Sample Dataset :-
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis

- Used Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset
- Cleaned data, preprocessed text, and encoded variables
- Conducted EDA, analyzed sentiment scores distribution, and visualized sentiment trends
- Applied sentiment analysis using Power BI techniques and created interactive visualizations

Task-05
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Dataset :-
https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshalbhamare/us-accident-eda

-Explore traffic accident data to identify patterns and trends.

-Leveraged Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, and Pandas for data analysis and visualization.

-Expertise in data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

-Advanced skills in data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy.



These tasks have not only enhanced my technical skills but also my ability to tackle complex data challenges and derive meaningful insights. I'm excited to continue growing and exploring new opurtunity.
These tasks have been a fantastic learning experience, honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Looking forward to applying these skills in future projects! #DataScience #MachineLearning #DataAnalysis #ProdigyInfoTech #Internship
